## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of how generative AI can assist in improving code quality, particularly in the context of R data analysis and visualization projects. The project highlights various improvements made to the code, including refactoring for efficiency, adopting coding conventions, and enhancing documentation.

## Chat Summary

During a chat session, we discussed and improved the code and documentation for this project. Notable changes and enhancements made during the chat include:

- Refactoring code to use more efficient vectorized operations.
- Adopting camel case naming conventions for variables and functions.
- Modifying the `savePlots` function to exclude `NULL` entries for months without data.
- Naming elements of the `savedPlots` list after month names for clarity.
- Providing detailed documentation for the project, including function descriptions and project structure.

## Project Structure

- R/
  - analyze_data.R        # R script for data analysis
- data/
  - airquality.csv        # Air quality dataset
- output/
  - plots/                # Directory for saved plot images
- .gitignore             # Git ignore file

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and the required libraries (ggplot2, tidyverse) installed.
3. Run the `analyze_data.R` script to analyze the data and generate plots.

```bash
Rscript R/analyze_data.R
```

## Functions

### `calculateMonthlyAverages(data)`

This function calculates monthly averages for Solar Radiation in the given data.

- `data`: Input data frame containing the dataset.
- Returns a data frame with monthly averages.

### `calculateMonthlyCorrelations(data)`

This function calculates monthly correlations between Ozone and Solar Radiation in the given data.

- `data`: Input data frame containing the dataset.
- Returns a data frame with monthly correlations.

### `savePlots(data, filePrefix)`

This function generates scatter plots for each month based on Solar Radiation and Ozone data. Plots are saved as both image files and objects.

- `data`: Input data frame containing the dataset.
- `filePrefix`: A string to be used as a prefix for saved image files.
- Returns a list of scatter plots named after the corresponding month.

## Data Cleaning

The script removes rows with missing values (NA) before analysis.

## Visualization

Plots are saved as image files in the `output/plots/` directory. Additionally, plots are stored as objects in the `savedPlots` list.
